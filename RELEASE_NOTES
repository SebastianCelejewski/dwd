# Release Notes

## Version dwd_0.1.0
- Initial implementation allowing to view and add measurements
- A measurement has its date and time, dyspnoea value (0: none, 1: low, 2: medium, 3: high) and a comment
- There is no authentication or authorization
- Works as a web application on mobile phones
- Code is unfortunately low quality, because those are my first steps in React and AWS Amplify
